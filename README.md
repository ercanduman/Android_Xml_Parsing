# Android Xml Parsing

This an Android application with XML parsing codes.

The url I have used is available in values/string.xml file.

The application check internet connection as well. If there is no connection, it shows some TOAST message such as:


If there is internet connection;

the application show a dialog while parsing data from the internet (Loading, please wait...)

When finished, it shows all data in two different Textviews (title, description)

If data first loaded it does not let you load it again. I created a flag called "isTaskExecuted" which not let execute task again.

It shows monthly horoscope information, if you like you can change it to daily, yearly, etc.

Hope it helps someone :+1: :) If you want to see some real project I have created with json parsing codes, please check my android daily horoscope application: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ercanduman.dailyhoroscope
