# Android_Xml_Parsing

This an Android application with XML parsing codes.

The url I have used is available in values/string.xml file.

The application check internet connection as well. If there is no connection, it shows some TOAST message such as:


If there is internet connection;

the application show a dialog while parsing data from the internet (Loading, please wait...)
when finished it shows all data in three different Textviews (title, date, details)
